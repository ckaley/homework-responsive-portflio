# This is the first homework assignment for teh Bootstrap homework, Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. This assignment requires the developer to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

# Description

Create a responsive website that consists of thre html pages linked together. The navigation shoudl be the same on each page, as well as the footer. The index page will be the personal Bio of Craig. The second page is a portfolio page that displays images. Lastly is the contact page that will display a form to enter your name, email address and message to send. The page will not send an email however.

## Steps that were followed

- Created the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`. in the root directory

- linked to the bookstrap ssite in the header of each file

- Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

  - A navbar

  - A responsive layout

  - Responsive images

- Did not use media queries at all. Wodner if I should have.

- Added in the assets folder Craig's portfolio pictiure to use on the about me page

- Used Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns). I will say as the files grew in size, it started to become difficult to keep track of the tags.

- Used the HTML validation service tfrom https://validator.w3.org

### Minimum Requirements to be addressed

- Functional, deployed application

- GitHub repository with README describing the project

- Navbar must be consistent on each page.

- Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

- All links must work.

- Must use semantic html.

- Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

- Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

- Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

### Bonus (did not try)

- Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
